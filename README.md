# SeniorProject
Code used for experimentation with MesoInception-4 model related to research for my senior project

All of the code for the model is located in MesoInception4_DF.ipynb

In order to run this code you will need to retrive the data yourself which is 
available at [https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics/tree/master/dataset](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics/tree/master/dataset)
You must apply to gain access to the data and the owner will email you a script to allow you to download the images. 

Since my code takes a very long time to run I have included screenshots of the runs and output available in 
this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBUTYflDUaZAu2HDGXTFQXShBmplz4MjuXcscMpLlsk/edit?usp=sharing)
